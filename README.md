# Aut(F_4) has Property (T)

This repository contains code associated to the article "Computer proofs for Property (T), and SDP duality", available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05134 .

The script VerifySolution verifies the property (T) witness available at https://zenodo.org/record/7065231 .
It is quite slow, but meant to be relatively accessible.

The folder previous_versions contains code that is associated with earlier preprints of the article. It generates the simplified property (T) SDP, solves it and verifies the solution in an efficient manner. But it is less accessible and it is harder to verify that the code is correct.
